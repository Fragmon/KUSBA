# Versions
|Version|Notes|
|---|---|
|v1.0|Read the main [Readme](../README.md#version-10) file for more information.|
|v2.0|Not included here because it didn't work. More info about v2 vs v1 is on the main [Readme](../README.md).|
|v2.1|Fixed the v2.0 communication problems.|
||Many components are relocated.|
||LED is removed because it was unnecessary.|
||PCB is smaller now (35.6mmx25mm).|
|v2.2|THIS VERSION IS UNTESTED but very similar to v2.1. It was going to be v2.1 but I ordered the wrong gerbers :)|
||Made the PCB slightly larger (36.4mmx25mm) to allow the use of M3 screws.|
||Made some test pads larger.|
||Files are in the old versions folder because this is untested.|

# The files are temporarily removed to diagnose a bug with the crystal that seems to only affect about 20% of PCBs.
